/* 

Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.
A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.
For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.

Input : s = "abcde" , goal = "cdeab"

Output : true

Explanation :

After performing 2 shifts we can achieve the goal string from string s.
After first shift the string s is => bcdea
After second shift the string s is => cdeab.
