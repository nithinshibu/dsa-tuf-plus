Understanding Time and Space Complexity:

In software engineering, every algorithm possesses a certain level of complexity, which is crucial in determining its efficiency. Complexity is typically measured in two ways:

Time Complexity: The amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It provides a way to quantify the efficiency of an algorithm by expressing how the execution time grows as the input size increases.

Space Complexity: The amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. It accounts for the total amount of space required by the algorithm, including the space used by variables, data structures, and function call stacks.

Understanding both time and space complexity is essential for writing optimized code, as it helps in choosing the most efficient algorithm for a given problem. Efficient algorithms not only reduce the time taken to execute but also minimize the resources required, which is especially important in large-scale applications and systems with limited resources.
